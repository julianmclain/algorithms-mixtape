# Hash Maps

Algorithmic applications of hash maps:

- When you need to store 2 pieces of related together (key, value)
- When you want fast information lookup by key [common restaurant example](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/hash-table/184/comparison-with-other-data-structures/1177/)
- When you want to aggregate information by key
  - e.g. Counter in Python [first unique character example](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/hash-table/184/comparison-with-other-data-structures/1119/)
  - e.g. Designing a key function that will group data [Design the key](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/hash-table/185/hash_table_design_the_key/1125/)
