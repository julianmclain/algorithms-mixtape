# Breadth First Search (BFS)

TODO: Draw diagram with layers

- Explore the nodes in "layers." If the starting point *S* is layer 0, then the neighbors of *S* constitute layer 1, the neighbors of vertices in layer 1 constitute layer 2, and so forth.
- Intuitively, you can think of it as a cautious way to explore the graph.
- It's a good solution for computing shortest paths.
- Can be used for computing connected components of an undirected graph in linear time.
- Uses a queue (FIFO)
