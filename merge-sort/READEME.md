# Merge Sort

Merge Sort was known to John von Neumann as early as 1945. Despite being over 70 years old, it's still one of the sorting algorithms of choice today. It's a canonical divide-and-conquer algorithm because it recusrively breaks the problem into subproblems and then combines the subproblem solutions into a final result.

## Analysis

At most, Merge Sort requires 6n * log<sub>2</sub>n + 6n operations where n is the number of elements in the list.
